# hscore
> Midi to Sheet Music Transcription (552 Final Project by Kyven Wu, Sherry Shi)

## Purpose
hscore reads MIDI files using [Euterpea](https://github.com/Euterpea/Euterpea2) and outputs graphical sheet music by generating [LilyPond code](http://lilypond.org/text-input.html).

## Usage
`stack run {midi filepath} {optional config filepath}`

e.g.

`stack run demo/dream.mid demo/dream.yaml`

or, interactively:

`stack run`

### IMPORTANT
hscore needs two things to successfully generate a score:

1. The input midi must only contain notes that can be written as a regular note, a dotted note, or a double-dotted note.

2. The input midi must be 120bpm. you can import your file into [Online Sequencer](https://onlinesequencer.net/) and redownload it at 120bpm. This constraint is inherited from Euterpea's MIDI parsing code.

## Configuration
Configuration is in YAML format and is done on the per-input level.

A sample configuration is
```
title: "And Your Dream Comes True - The Beach Boys"
adjustAccidentals : True
sections:
  - key:
      keyPitch : Df
      keyMode: Major
    time:
      numerator: 2
      denominator: 4
    measures: 6
  - key:
      keyPitch : C
      keyMode: Major
    time:
      numerator: 4
      denominator: 4
midi:
  tempo: 120
```

Every key is optional -- the default (implicit) configuration looks like:
```
adjustAccidentals : True
sections:
  - key:
      keyPitch : C
      keyMode: Major
    time:
      numerator: 4
      denominator: 4
```
Also, note that if the measure key is unspecified, the section will last for the rest of the music.

### Using configurations
By default, when hscore is given `test.mid`, it will look for `test.yaml` to find configuration.
Alternatively, you can pass in a configuration filepath when running hscore:
`stack run test.mid otherconfig.yaml`

## Building, running, and testing

This project compiles with `stack build`. 

You can add any needed library dependencies and update project metadata in [package.yaml](package.yaml). You should NOT edit the `.cabal` file. It is automatically generated by running Stack; see [this article](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/stack_yaml_vs_cabal_package_file/) for more information.

You can run the main executable with `stack run`.
You can run the tests with `stack test`. 

Lastly, you can start a REPL with `stack ghci`.


## Notable Features 
### MVP 

1. Haskell Translation From Euterpea syntax to LilyPond music text syntax
    - Create a LilyPond Haskell Representation [LilyPondSyntax.hs](src/LilyPondSyntax.hs)
    - Implement Pretty Printer to translate LilyPond Haskell to LilyPond text [LilyPondPrinter.hs](src/LilyPondPrinter.hs)
    - Translate Duration of notes from Haskell rational duration to LilyPond text duration (non-trivial, see [formatDuration](src/LilyPondPrinter.hs))
2. Basic sequential, one-line music conversion from MIDI -> Sheet Music
3. Basic parallel, multi-staff music conversion from MIDI -> Sheet Music 
    - Aligning parallel notes in exactly the right places (non-trivial, see [getRawStaves](src/EuterpeaConverter.hs))
4. Integrate entire MIDI->PDF pipeline, including the "lilypond" terminal command into one main Function

### Bonus Features

5. Create staves of sections of measures accurately according to key signature and time signature
    - Break notes up into different measures as needed with a tie
6. Polish sheet music to be better style by musical conventions! 
    - Auto-adjust note accidentals according to the key signature (Ex: c# in a Db key becomes a Db so the music doesn't print the accidental)
    - Auto-guess the clef of a staff based on how many notes are above or below center C
    - Clean up rests (separate, consecutive $ rests within a measure get merged into one)
    - Sort the staves with the highest first note is at the top, with the tie-breaker sort being the staff with more notes goes higher
7. Make the # of parts in our output sheet music true to the correct number of parts as shown in the "gold standard" sheet music
    - First sort the staves in descending order of how many notes are in the staff
    - Merge upwards all combinations of parallel measures that can be joined together like puzzle non-trivial, see [tryCombineMeasures](src/LilyPondPostProcess.hs))
    - Clean staves so there are no empty staves  
8. Read and implement user-specified music configurations through a .yaml file 
    -  Adjust music according to user specified Time and Key signatures for different parts of the music
    - Allow users to specify whether they want auto-adjusted accidentals 
    - Adjust music according to the user specifies that there is a pick-up measure
