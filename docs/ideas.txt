- format accidentals based on key (e.g. F key has one flat on B)
- if a pitch is equal to A# or Bb, then default to just printing "b"
- allow user input for key/time-signature for x measures
- default: automatically try to figure it out / just use 4/4, C key
- all one execution: output PDF and ask user to verify and prompt for key/time
